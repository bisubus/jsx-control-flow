# jsx-control-flow

A lightweight library providing React components for declarative control flow in JSX. The components are supposed to replace short-circuit operators, complex ternaries, `Array.map()`, and IIFEs.

Inspired by frameworks like Vue (`v-for`, `v-if`) and Angular (`@for`, `@if`, `@switch`, `@let`), this library brings similar declarative functionality to React.
